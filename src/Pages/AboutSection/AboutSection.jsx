              <p>
                Hello, my name is Kyi Thar Soe. I'm 23 years old. My education
                background is that I studied IT major at Mawlamyine University
                of Technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                I bring 2 years of experience in the field of web development,
                including 1 year as a front-end web developer at a Japanese
                company. My technical expertise encompasses a strong
                understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and WordPress.
                Additionally, I am proficient in modern frameworks and libraries
                such as React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. I am also
                experienced with RESTful APIs and Git for version control and
                have foundational knowledge of Node.js. Beyond coding, I am
                well-versed in design systems and UX research related to web
                design. I hold certifications and achievements in web
                development, React, and UI/UX web design. My portfolio includes
                diverse projects, such as E-commerce platforms, admin
                dashboards, movie applications, education platforms, and other
                real-world projects. Notably, as part of a team working on an
                Education Platform project, we were honored with the best prize
                for our efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, I strongly value teamwork and open communication. I look
                forward to embracing new challenges, contributing innovative
                ideas, and crafting web experiences that resonate with users and
                leave a lasting impact. I am passionate about delivering
                high-quality, user-focused web experiences and continuously
                improving my skills to excel in the ever-evolving tech
                landscape.
